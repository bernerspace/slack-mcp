- **Sensitive Permissions**: Be extra careful with `users:read.email`, `groups:history`, `files:read`
- **Regular Audits**: Review and remove unused permissions
- **User Communication**: Clearly explain why each permission is needed

## üìù Notes

- Some permissions require workspace admin approval
- Bot permissions are different from user permissions (OAuth scopes)
- Permissions can be updated after installation (with user consent)
- Always test with minimal permissions first
